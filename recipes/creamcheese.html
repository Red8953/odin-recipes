        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 Cup unsalted butter (1 stick) softened</li>
            <li>4 Ounces cream cheese (softened)</li>
            <li>1 & 1/2 Cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon vanilla bean paste or extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 & 3/4 Cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cream together the butter and cream cheese until smooth. Slowly mix in powdered sugar until combined. Then add in the egg, baking powder,
                vanilla and salt. Mix to combine. Slowly add in flour, scraping the bowl as needed. Store in fridge to rest for at least 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375F. Combine the ground cinnamon and sugar, then set to the side.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into 1 inch balls. Roll each ball into the cinnamon sugar that was set aside. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and 
                place the dough balls on the tray 2 inches apart.
            </li>
            <li>Bake the cookies for 9-11 minutes. Be careful not to overbake the cookies - they should be set and slightly puffed up. Cool the cookies 
                on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.
            </li>
