            <li>1/2 Cup sliced almonds</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>

        <h3>To Top The Cookies</h3>
            <li>1 Cup mini marshmallows</li>
            <li>Extra sliced almonds</li>
            <li>Extra chocolate chips</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350F (or later if you decide to let the cookies chill before baking). In a bowl combine the flour, cocoa powder, 
                baking soda, salt, and  1/2 cup chocolate chips.
            </li>
            <li>In a different bowl cream together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar on low.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix on low. Slowly add the dry ingredients and mix on low or by hand until fully combined.</li>
            <li>Use a cookie scoop to drop the dough balls onto a lined baking sheet. Press 3-4 mini-marshmallows into each cookie along with extra
                almond pieces and chocolate chips.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure the cookies are at least 3 inches apart. Place the tray in the oven and bake the cookies for 10-13 minutes. Let the cookies cool
                on the sheet for 10 minutes and then transfer to a cooling rack to finish cooling.
            </li>
        </ol>
