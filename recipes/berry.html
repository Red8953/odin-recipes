            <li>3 Tablespoons water</li>
            <li>3/4 Cup sugar</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons cornstarch</li>

        <h3>Whipped Mascarpone Frosting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 & 1/2 Cups heavy whipping cream, chilled</li>
            <li>1 & 1/2 Cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>16 Ounces mascarpone cheese, chilled</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Cake Layers</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F and prepare three 8 inch cake pans with non stick baking spray and parchment paper. Parchment paper on the bottom 
                of the pan will greatly help with preventing sticking.
            </li>
            <li>Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl then set aside.</li>
            <li>In a smaller bowl, mix the milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and eggs.</li>
            <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients and mix well.</li>
            <li>Slowly add in water to the batter and mix on low until combined. Scrape the sides of the bowl to ensure everything is well combined.</li>
            <li>Evenly pour the batter between the three prepared cake pans. Bake for 24-28 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few
                moist crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the cakes and allow to cool for a few minutes. Then move them to a cooling rack to finish cooling completely.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Berry Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the berries and water to a food processor and blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Combine the sugar and cornstarch in a medium saucepan. Add in the berry puree.</li>
            <li>Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly. Continue for 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once it comes to a boil, continue to stir for 1 minute. Then, remove from heat and refrigerate, allowing it to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Frosting and Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar and vanilla extract to a large mixing bowl. Beat on high until soft peaks begin to form.</li>
            <li>Add the mascarpone cheese to the whipped cream and beat until stiff peaks form. Keep the whipped frosting cooled in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Remove the domes of the cooled cakes with a serrated knife to create a flat work area on each cake.</li>
            <li>Place the first cake layer and then pipe a dam of frosting around the outside of the cake.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the berry filling on top of the cake inside of the dam.</li>
            <li>Pipe additional frosting onto the berry filling and spread into an evening layer.</li>
            <li>Add the second layer of cake on top and repeat the filling layer with additional frosting and berry filling.</li>
            <li>Add the final cake layer on top and smooth out frosting around the outsides of the cake.</li>
            <li>Finish frosting the outside of the cake and use your preferred tool to smooth the sides and/or add a pattern.</li>
            <li>Finish by decorating with additional icing and berries.</li>
            <li>Keep cake refrigerated until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
